# Task 3 – Image Captioning AI 📷📝

This project generates natural language captions for images using computer vision and NLP.

## 🧠 How It Works:
- Uses **Vision Transformer (ViT)** to extract image features
- Uses **GPT-2** to generate natural language captions
- Built using HuggingFace's `vit-gpt2-image-captioning` model

## ✅ Features:
- Accepts any image input
- Returns meaningful captions like:
  - 🐱 "a cat sitting on a windowsill looking outside"
  - 🏔️ "a mountain range with snow covered peaks"
  - 🏙️ "a city skyline with tall buildings at night"

## 📂 Project Files:
- `image_captioning.ipynb` – main notebook
- `/images/` – test images
- `README.md` – this file

## 📚 Libraries Used:
- Transformers
- TensorFlow
- PIL
- Matplotlib

## 🧠 Learning Outcome:
This task helped me understand how **computer vision and NLP** can be combined using modern transformer-based models.
