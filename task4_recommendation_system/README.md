# Task 4 â€“ Recommendation System ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“š

This project is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests similar movies based on genre similarity.

## ðŸ§  How It Works:
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** on movie genres
- Computes **cosine similarity** between movies
- Suggests top similar movies for a selected title

## ðŸ“š Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ§ª Sample Output:
**Input**: Inception  
**Recommendations**:
- The Matrix  
- The Avengers  
- Titanic

## ðŸš€ Learning Outcome:
This project helped me understand how **feature-based filtering** works and how **vector similarity** powers recommendation engines.
