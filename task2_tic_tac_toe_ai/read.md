# Task 2 – Tic-Tac-Toe AI 🎮

This is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built as part of my Artificial Intelligence internship at **CodSoft**.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ **Play against an AI** powered by the **Minimax algorithm**
- 🎯 **Three difficulty levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard
- 🧠 **AI never loses** in Hard mode
- 🖥️ Simple, clean UI with instant win/draw detection
- 🔄 "New Game" button to reset and restart anytime

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **Minimax algorithm** (for hard difficulty)
- Random and semi-strategic logic (for easy and medium)

## 🧠 AI Logic

| Difficulty | Logic Used |
|------------|-------------|
| Easy       | Random moves |
| Medium     | Prioritized but non-perfect strategy |
| Hard       | Full Minimax Algorithm (perfect AI) |

The Minimax algorithm evaluates all possible moves and chooses the one that minimizes the possible loss for the worst-case scenario.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

This project helped me:
- Understand **game theory**
- Implement **search-based AI**
- Improve my **front-end skills** while integrating logic-based AI
